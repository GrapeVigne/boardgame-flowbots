            <p>Many board games can be played solo using some kind of artificial intelligence, often nicknamed a 'bot'.  These vary greatly in complexity, with some of the more complicated involving flowcharts to simulate the bot's decision making.</p>

              <p>As a big fan of the GMT Games COIN series who would often try to tackle the games solo, I became very familiar with the flowcharts and A.I. decision making involved.  Personally, while maybe not perfect, I find them to be excellent ways to play the game.  However, following the flowchart was not always the simplest of experiences.</p>
              <p>The main pitfalls I found were, firstly, that the text on the flowchart itself was often truncated, and so not always as clear as the rulebook.  Secondly, the flowchart itself could be a little tricky to navigate and keep track on.</p>
              <p>Well, since I had recently been learning a little bit of web development, I decided to take one of the GMT Games (Colonial Twilight as it happened) and see if I could turn the flowchart into a webpage that walked you through each bot turn, step by step. One thing led to another, and one game became several, and the webapp you have here was born.</p>

            <p>My sincere hope is that other players may also find this useful and enjoyable to use, and that some of those solo bots will get to see  a little more play from time to time.</p>

          <p>This webapp is designed to take you through the decision making process for the various bots provided with the games.  It does not automate the decisions, but will walk you through the decision making processes step-by-step.</p>  
          <p>At each step, read through the options and follow the instructions provided carefully, and if necessary, click the appropriate buttons to proceed.</p>
          <p>Each time you need to start a new bot turn you will begin again at the start. The webapp itself should take you to where you need to be at all times.</p>
