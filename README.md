A learning experiment to turn some complicated flowchart into an interactive webpage.

Originally I'd selected GMT Games' Colonial Twilight bot flowchart as the basis for my experiment, but the project kind of took on a life of its own, and I decided to expand this out to more games.

This was purely for my own purposes, done as a learning exercise, and not intended to be used by anyone, so I did not tried to obtain any permissions.
