        <h2>About the Flowbot Project:</h2>
        <p>Many board games can be played solo using some kind of artificial intelligence, often nicknamed a 'bot'.  These vary greatly in complexity, with some of the more complicated involving flowcharts to simulate the A.I. decision making.</p>
        <p>As a big fan of the GMT Games COIN series who would often try to tackle the games so, I became very familiar with the flowcharts and A.I. involved.  Personally, while maybe not perfect, I find them to be excellent ways to play the game.  However, following the flowcharts was not always the easiest of experiences.</p>
        <p>The main pitfalls I personally found were, firstly, that the text on the flowchart itself was often truncated, and so not always clear.  Secondly, the flowchart itself could be a little tricky to navigate.</p>
        <p>Well, I have recently been learning a little bit of web development, and so decided to take one of the GMT Games (Colonial Twilight as it happened) and see if I could turn the flowchart into a webpage that walked you through each bot turn, step by step. One think led to another, and one game became several, and the monster you have here was born.</p>
        <p>My sincere hope is that some other players out there may find this useful and enjoyable to use also, and that some of those solo bots will get to see  a little more play time.</p>
