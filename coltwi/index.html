              <h2>About Colonial Twilight:</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Colonial Twilight is the 7th game in the GMT Counter-Insurgency (COIN) series, putting players into military and political action comprising the French-Algerian war of 1954-62. It is primarily designed as a 2 player game, but it can be played solo using the FLN Bot flowchart.</p>
            <p>The insurgent Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), starting from modest beginnings, must build massive and enduring popular support for its cause and organize to assume power when Algeria finally gains its independence.</p>
            <p> The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France’s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society.</p><p>Players will enter the “heart of darkness” as they use military, political, and economic actions and exploit events to build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population or otherwise achieve their aims along the twisting route to independence.</p>
            <p>Due to the complexity of the Government faction's strategies, a bot was never developed to play this side, so solo play is always against the FLN.</p>

              <h2>How to use this app:</h2>
            </div>
            <p>This app is designed to take you through the decision making process for the FLN Bot provided with the game.  It does not automate the decisions, but will walk you through the flowchart step-by-step.</p>  
            <p>If you need to run the FLN turn, choose "FLN Turn".</p>
            <p>If it's a Propaganda round that you need to resolve, choose "Propaganda Round".</p>
            <p>And if you're looking for a random space, use "Choose a Space". You can make your choices at each stage by clicking on the appropriate button.</p><br>

              <h2>When running the bot:</h2>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li>For the one-player game of Colonial Twilight, it is strongly recommended that the Player sets up the Short Scenario as the rules have been optimized for this scenario.</li>
              <li>Conduct each action to the fullest extent until eligible spaces or Resources run out.</li>
              <li>Unlike other games in the COIN Series, the Non-Player only gets those options that are available to it per the Sequence of Play. If the Non-Player is Second Eligible, its choice of available options will be limited by what the Player did.</li>
              <li>When the Non-Player begins the turn with zero Resources, and will not or cannot Extort or execute the Event, it Passes instead.</li>
