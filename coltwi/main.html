        <h3>About Colonial Twilight:</h3>
        <p>Colonial Twilight is the 7th game in the GMT Counter-Insurgency (COIN) series, putting players into military and political action comprising the French-Algerian war of 1954-62. It is primarily designed as a 2 player game, but it can be played solo using the FLN Bot flowchart.</p>
        <p>The insurgent Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), starting from modest beginnings, must build massive and enduring popular support for its cause and organize to assume power when Algeria finally gains its independence. The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France’s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society. Players will enter the “heart of darkness” as they use military, political, and economic actions and exploit events to build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population or otherwise achieve their aims along the twisting route to independence.</p>

            <h3>How to use this app:</h3>
            <p>This app is designed to take you through the decision making process for the FLN Bot provided with the game.  It does not automate the decisions, but will walk you through the flowchart step-by-step.</p>  
            <p>If you need to run the FLN turn, choose "FLN Turn".  If it's a Propaganda round that you need to resolve, choose "Propaganda Round". And if your looking for a random space, use "Choose a Space". You can make your choices at each stage by clicking on the appropriate button.</p>

            <h3>Things to remember when running the bot:</h3>
            <p>Conduct each action to the fullest extent until eligible spaces or Resources run out.</p>
            <p>When the Non-Player begins the turn with zero Resources, and will not or cannot execute the Event or Extort, it Passes instead.</p>
            <p>If there is a choice, remove enemy Bases, then French before Algerians, then Troops before Police.</p>
            <p>If there is a choice, reduce Commitment first, then Support, then the France Track (toward box “F” only), then Government Resources.</p>
