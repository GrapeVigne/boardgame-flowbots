        <h3>About Colonial Twilight</h3>
        <p>Colonial Twilight is the 7th game in the GMT Counter-Insurgency (COIN) series, putting players into military and political action comprising the French-Algerian war of 1954-62. It is primarily designed as a 2 player game, but it can be played solo using the FLN Bot flowchart.</p>
        <p>The insurgent Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN), starting from modest beginnings, must build massive and enduring popular support for its cause and organize to assume power when Algeria finally gains its independence. The Government, representing both the colonial authorities and France’s military leadership, must engage the nationalist insurgency decisively while striving to preserve the support and commitment of the civilian government and society. Players will enter the “heart of darkness” as they use military, political, and economic actions and exploit events to build and maneuver forces to influence or control the population or otherwise achieve their aims along the twisting route to independence.</p>
        
        <h3>How to use this app</h3>
        <p>This app is designed to walk you through the decision making process for the FLN Bot provided with the game.  It does not automate the decisions, rather it is designed to walk you through the flowchart step-by-step.  At each step you will be given some information, and you may then need to either act on that or make a futher decision.</p>  
        <p>If you need to run the FLN turn, choose "FLN Turn".  If it's a propaganda round you'd like to resolve, choose "Propaganda Round".  And if your looking for a random space, use "Choose a Space". You can make your choices at each stage by clicking on the appropriate button.</p>
