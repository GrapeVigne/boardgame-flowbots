        <h3>About Race for the Galaxy</h3>
        <p>In the card game Race for the Galaxy, players build galactic civilizations by playing game cards in front of them that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Some worlds allow players to produce goods, which can be consumed later to gain either card draws or victory points when the appropriate technologies are available to them. These are mainly provided by the developments and worlds that are not able to produce, but the fancier production worlds also give these bonuses.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of each round, players select one of the seven roles which correspond to the phases in which the round progresses. By selecting a role, players activate that phase for this round, giving each player the opportunity to perform that phase's action, but the player who has chosen the role gets a bonus that applies only to them.</p>
        
        <h3>How to use this app</h3>
        <p>This app is designed to walk you through the decision making process for the flowchart found in <em>The Gathering Storm</em> expansion.  It does not automate the decisions, rather it is designed to walk you through the flowchart step-by-step.  At each step you will be given some information, and you may then need to either act on that or make a futher decision.</p>
        <p>To set up the flowchart for the Bot, click the "Bot Setup" button.</p>
        <p>If you've already set up the Bot on your own and you're ready to run the Bot's turn, click the "Bot Turn" button.</p>
